# 3D Aruco Evaluation

This submodule has four conponents: generation, calibration, detection, and evaluation. By Aruco functions provided by OpenCV, we can easily compare the mesh generated by models with the ground truth.

## Build

The module use xmake as building system. But the `CMakeLists.txt` is also provided. Feel free to choose whatever you like!

Here we demostrate using xmake
```bash
xmake # Build the project
```

## Usage

### Generation

Generate the charuco board
```bash
./generate -c=1 -d=10
```

Generate the charuco marker images
```bash
./generate -c=2 -d=10
```

Opencv **does not make any assumption on physical size or pattern size of your board**, so it doesn't matter how large you print it.

### Calibration

```bash
./calibrate_camera -d=10 -v=/data/robot-studio/evaluation/input/calibration.mp4 /workspace/gs_toolkit/configs/
```

### Detection

### Evaluation
