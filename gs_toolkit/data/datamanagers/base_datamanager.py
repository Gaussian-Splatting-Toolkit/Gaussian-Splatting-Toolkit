    """Generic data manager's abstract class

    This version of the data manager is designed be a monolithic way to load data and latents,
    especially since this may contain learnable parameters which need to be shared across the train
    and test data managers. The idea is that we have setup methods for train and eval separately and
    this can be a combined train/eval if you want.

    Usage:
    To get data, use the next_train and next_eval functions.
    This data manager's next_train and next_eval methods will return 2 things:

    1. 'rays': This will contain the rays or camera we are sampling, with latents and
        conditionals attached (everything needed at inference)
    2. A "batch" of auxiliary information: This will contain the mask, the ground truth
        pixels, etc needed to actually train, score, etc the model

    Rationale:
    Because of this abstraction we've added, we can support more GS paradigms beyond the
    vanilla GS paradigm of single-scene, fixed-images, no-learnt-latents.
    We can now support variable scenes, variable number of images, and arbitrary latents.


    Train Methods:
        setup_train: sets up for being used as train
        iter_train: will be called on __iter__() for the train iterator
        next_train: will be called on __next__() for the training iterator
        get_train_iterable: utility that gets a clean pythonic iterator for your training data

    Eval Methods:
        setup_eval: sets up for being used as eval
        iter_eval: will be called on __iter__() for the eval iterator
        next_eval: will be called on __next__() for the eval iterator
        get_eval_iterable: utility that gets a clean pythonic iterator for your eval data


    Attributes:
        train_count (int): the step number of our train iteration, needs to be incremented manually
        eval_count (int): the step number of our eval iteration, needs to be incremented manually
        train_dataset (Dataset): the dataset for the train dataset
        eval_dataset (Dataset): the dataset for the eval dataset
        includes_time (bool): whether the dataset includes time information
