Gaussian Splatting Toolkit
============================

The Gaussian Splatting Toolkit is an open-source framework designed to facilitate new view synthesis and 3D reconstruction using Gaussian splatting techniques. It provides a set of tools and algorithms that enable researchers and developers to create explicit 3D representations for scene rendering, offering a novel approach to visualizing and manipulating three-dimensional data. With its modular design and comprehensive documentation, the Gaussian Splatting Toolkit aims to advance the field of robotics research and computer vision by making cutting-edge 3D reconstruction techniques more accessible and efficient.
